# SASS Installation Steps (Windows / general)

1. Ensure Node.js is installed (recommended v20.16.0). Download from https://nodejs.org or use nvm.
2. Open PowerShell and verify node and npm are available:
   node -v
   npm -v
3. Install sass (Dart Sass) locally or globally. To install locally in a project:
   npm init -y
   npm install sass@3.7.4 --save-dev

   Or install globally (requires admin privileges):
   npm install -g sass@3.7.4

4. Verify installation:
   sass --version

5. Compile or run sass files as required, for example:
   sass 0-debug_log.scss

Notes:
- On Ubuntu you can use nvm to install Node.js: curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
- After installing nvm, run: nvm install 20.16.0
- Then install sass via npm as shown above.
